Project Description/Outline: 
We will be using weather data and available GDP data to establish correlations between rainfall and temperature changes.   We will further analyze the possible effects on the three classifications of GDP. 
Research Questions to Answer:
1.	How Temperature changes affect the GDP in the chosen countries
•	Look for discernable trends in GDP with respect to temperature fluctuations over a 10-year period.
2.	How Annual changes in Precipitation affect the GDP in the chosen countries
•	Look for discernable trends in GDP with respect to annual temperature over a 10-year period.
3.	How Weather affects GDP in Agricultural based economies
•	Analyze changes in temperature and/or precipitation for countries whose GDP is predominantly agricultural based, e.g., Suriname: 0.53%, Greenland: 0.57%, Singapore: 0.95%, and the Bahamas: 1.40%.
4.	How Weather affects GDP in Industrial based economies
•	Analyze changes in temperature and/or precipitation for countries whose GDP is predominantly industry based, e.g., Saudi Arabia: 44.2%, United Arab Emirates: 49.8%, Iraq: 51%, Qatar: 50.3%, Kuwait: 58.7%, Angola: 61.4%, Azerbaijan: 53.5%, Puerto Rico: 50.1%, Libya: 52.3%.
5.	How Weather affects GDP in Service based economies
•	Analyze changes in temperature and/or precipitation for countries whose GDP is predominantly service based, e.g., European Union: 70.9%, United States: 80%, United Kingdom: 79.2%, Hong Kong: 92.3%, Panama: 82%, Lebanon: 83%, Macau: 93.7%, Bermuda: 93.8%.

Data Sets to be Used: 

RESTful API: http://restcountries.eu/
Countries by GDP Sector Composition: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_sector_composition
Weather Data: https://climateknowledgeportal.worldbank.org/download-datahttps://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/NGDP_RPCH@WEO/OEMDC/ADVEC/WEOWORLD?year=2020
GDP Data: https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD


Rough Breakdown of Tasks: 
Each team member will answer one of the five questions posed above.  Additionally, we will all work together on API’s, merging/building the data sets in Jupyter Notebook, the powerpoint presentation, and final report.
